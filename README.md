# uniArchive: Introduction to AI
#### This is a collection of training and trial Jupyter notebooks with common machine-learning problems/solutions.

- This code was partly produced as a solution to tasks I had to do at UiO's Computer Science Program. I abstracted as much as possible to not enable outright cheating in the class. But by now, ChatGPT would handle all of these tasks perfectly fine anyways and I doubt these tasks are still used.

**Credits:** Credit for these tasks goes to the UiO's Computer Science Program. Please refer to the University of Oslo and me when quoting this code
